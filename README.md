# 🌊 AquaSense - Major Project Backend Code

Welcome to the backend core of **AquaSense**, a smart IoT-based water management system that automatically monitors and controls household water tank levels using real-time sensor data and intelligent logic.

This repository contains the **main backend code** for handling the automation logic, ESP-based controller communication, water flow monitoring, and decision-making system of the AquaSense project.

## 🚀 Project Overview

AquaSense aims to solve the problem of water wastage and overflow by automating the process of water tank management. This is the **backend brain** of the system that makes real-time decisions such as:

- Monitoring water tank levels
- Detecting government water supply availability
- Automatically turning ON/OFF the motor
- Providing APIs for real-time updates to the frontend/dashboard
- Logging data to platforms like ThingSpeak (if used)
